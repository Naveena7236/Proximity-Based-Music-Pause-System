Proximity sensing refers to the ability of a system or device to detect the presence or absence
of an object or a person within a specific range without physical contact. Detecting nearby
vehicle’s and their sound monitoring are crucial while driving to reduce distractions. In-
car distractions, like music, can hinder driver attention and contribute to accidents. The
Proximity-Based Music Pause System focuses on car safety by introducing a system that
automatically pauses music playback when vehicles come close. Some of the existing solutions
such as Integration lacks real-time detection capabilities, require manual intervention and
high cost. To overcome this problem, proximity sensor technology is introduced which was
integrated into the vehicle’s infrastructure to monitor proximity data and detect close-range
vehicle encounters. It offers automated and proactive music pause functionality to mitigate
distractions. The system improves driver attention, reduces cognitive load, and enhances
communication between drivers by minimizing audio distractions.
